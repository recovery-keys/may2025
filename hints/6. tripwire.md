# Trip wire steps: Recovering L2 Data

### Step 0 : Environment

1. Download a portable Linux distribution onto a USB drive. [Read](https://www.tecmint.com/install-linux-os-on-usb-drive/)

2. Boot from the USB drive.

3. Download the `latest` recovery-keys.

4. Download the latest password hash gen app :  [password_hash_gen v1.0.0](https://github.com/compilable/Security_Utils)

5. Make sure you can execute the password_hash_gen.py file.

* Install Python on your local machine by [downloading a portable version](https://www.portablepython.com/download/)

- Install required packages

```

pip install PyQt6

```

- Run the script using a Python interpreter.

```

python password_hash_gen.py

```



### Step 1: Access bitwardan

1. Register / log in to a Google account.

2. Navigate to the latest recovery-keys repo.

3. Find the answer text from `seed.txt` based on the answer to the below question:

```

    Month and Date I was admitted to the 1st University (MMDD)

```

4. Copy the answer text and append to the URL below by replacing the word `APPEND_HERE` to create the Google Form URL:

```

    https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/APPEND_HERE/viewform?usp=header

```

5. Use the generated URL to access the `Bitwarden Backup Codes` locations by answering the questions in the form.

```

- User name : <you should know!>

- Password: Generate the answer from `3. password-manager.md` hints.

- 2FA: <use the provided backup key in the Google form.>

```

6.  Install the Bitwarden plugin to your browser and log in using the above credentials. 



### Step 2: Access L2 snapshot.

1. Obtain the L2 download URL from Bitwarden:

```

L2 - Tripware

```

2. Download the L2 snapshot from the URL.

3. Generate the L2 decrption key by using the `password_hash_gen` <4. layer_2_vol.md>

4. Mount the L2 image:

![Mount L2 as an image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recovery-keys/may2025/refs/heads/master/images/attach_l2.jpg?raw=true)


### Step 3: Access L2 data.

1. Once L2 is mounted as a read-only file system, restore the 2FA to a mobile app.

2. Restore email (may need to confirm logins)

3. Decrypt each KeePass as needed.


### Step 4: Recover L1 data.

1. Refer to the `L1_recovery_steps.html` found in `backup_recovery` folder.


### Circuit breaker: In case of an emergency:

1. Unpublish the google form.

2. Rotate Bitwarden key / email.

3. Remove L2 snapshot share from Bitwarden.
